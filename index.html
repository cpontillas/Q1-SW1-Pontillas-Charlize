	<h1 style="color: black; text-align: center;">Why I Love Metal</h1>
	<hr/>
	<p>Metal is a subgenre of rock and roll, getting its name from how its music is like. <br/> Heavy metal is usually characterized by loud distortion, electric guitars, strong repetitive rhythms, dense bass-drums, and vigorous vocals.</p>

	<h2 style="color: darkgrey;">My Favorite Metal Band</h2>
	<img src="ghost.jpg" alt="copia"width="300">
	<p>My <em>favorite</em> metal band of all time is <strong>The Band Ghost</strong>. <br/> Ghost is a Swedish metal band that currently consists of 9 members, including their lead vocalist, <strong>Tobias Forge</strong>, better known as <em>Papa Emeritus</em>. <br/> This band is my favorite because, like many others, I find their on-stage presence unique. <br/> Ghost presents their members in a way that the <em>identities</em> of them are <strong>hidden</strong> under matching, face-covered costumes and are called <strong>'Nameless Ghouls'</strong>. <br/> Besides that, the band also has an interesting backstory behind their frontman, why he is <strong>Papa Emeritus</strong>, a character like a <em>'demonic anti-pope'</em>.</p>

	<p>This is the band during their 3rd album release. <br/> As seen, their frontman is still Tobias Forge, though he plays the character <strong>Papa Emeritus III</strong> or Terzo, instead of <em>Papa Emeritus IV</em> (the current one). <br/> All of the "Papa"'s are brothers, their mother being Sister Imperator (<em>deceased</em>), the Head of the Nameless Ghouls, and their father being Papa Nihil (<em>deceased</em>), <br/> the Head of the Clergy which is basically what the band is called in their backstory/lore. <br/> Though with each album, there is a different one (minus Copia/Papa IV since he had two) because they are killed off after producing their album. </p>
